# Tomorrow
Tomorrow is an application program with a goal of making your tomorrow easier.
With busy weekdays and alot of things to do, it can be hard to keep track of everything in your life, and tomorrow wishes to be your solution to this.
<br/>

## What it does
Tomorrow simply lets you keep a calendar of tasks, with it's main focus being to plan your next day. The application is suitable both for personal use or for businesses, as it lets you create 'enviroments', which is a way to allow multiple users be assigned to the same task. Tasks can also exist of multiple 'subtasks', which together can make up more complex tasks.
<br/>

Each week, month and year, a report will be generated with statistics from the given time interval. The report will include information about how many tasks were completed, the percentage that were done, how it compares to the previous interval of the same amount of time, and other useful information.
<br/>

## What makes Tomorrow unique
Alot of other task tracking software makes tracking your tasks a task itself. Tomorrow aims to minimize the required effort for the user to track their tasks, while keeping functionality for those more invested.
