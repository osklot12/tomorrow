# Tomorrow
Tomorrow is a productivity tool with a goal of making your tomorrow easier.
With busy weekdays and alot of things to do, it can be hard to keep track of everything in your life, and tomorrow wishes to be your solution to this. Track your task progress for the day, week, month or year.
<br/>

## What it does
Tomorrow simply lets you keep a calendar of tasks, with it's main focus being to plan your next day. The application allows for tasks for short intervals, like a day, or longer intervals, like a year. Either way, Tomorrow will be your hub for all the tasks you have flying in your head. The application is suitable both for personal use or for businesses, as it lets you create 'enviroments', which is a way to allow multiple users be assigned to the same task. Tasks can also exist of multiple 'subtasks', which together can make up more complex tasks.
<br/>

Each week, month and year, a report will be generated with statistics from the given time interval. The report will include information about how many tasks were completed, the percentage that were done, how it compares to the previous interval of the same amount of time, and other useful information.
<br/>

## What makes Tomorrow unique
<ul>
<li>
**Fast and convenient**
<br/>
Alot of other task tracking software makes tracking your tasks a task itself. Tomorrow aims to minimize the required effort for the user to track their tasks, while keeping functionality for those more invested. Tracking your tasks should be easy and fast, and Tomorrow excels at exactly this.

**Functionality for the serious user**
<br/>
Some people say you got to choose between functionality and user friendlyness. We do not listen to that, and chose to aim for both. All extra functionality is presented in a way that does not interfere with the simplistic and user friendly design. This way, Tomorrow offers a more professional way of use for the serious user, without ruining the experience for the casual one.

<li>
**Suits both personal use and businesse**
<br/>
Tomorrow works just as good for personal use as it does for businesses. Get your own thoughts and plans into the application for a more structured life, or build an enviroment for your business and view reports with statistics. Either way, Tomorrow got your back.
